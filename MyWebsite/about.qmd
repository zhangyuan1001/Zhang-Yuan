## About Me

Dear Professor,  

My name is **Zhang Yuan**, and I am a primary school Chinese teacher. I graduated from **Jiangxi Normal University** with a major in **Chinese Language and Literature**. I have been teaching for **six years**, during which I have accumulated rich teaching experience.  

I love **reading**, especially books on **education** and **literature**. By reading educational books, I can constantly update my educational ideas and teaching methods. Literary works enrich my emotional world and enable me to better guide my students to appreciate the emotions in literary works.  

I also enjoy **sports**, such as **running**. Sports not only help me stay healthy but also cultivate **perseverance**. This perseverance subtly influences my life, enabling me to persistently seek solutions when facing difficulties.  

Thank you for visiting my page!
