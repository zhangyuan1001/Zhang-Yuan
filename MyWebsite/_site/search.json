I have been teaching for six years, during which I have accumulated rich teaching experience.\nI love reading, especially books on education and literature. By reading educational books, I can constantly update my educational ideas and teaching methods. Literary works enrich my emotional world and enable me to better guide my students to appreciate the emotions in literary works.\nI also enjoy sports, such as running. Sports not only help me stay healthy but also cultivate perseverance. This perseverance subtly influences my life, enabling me to persistently seek solutions when facing difficulties.\nThank you for visiting my page!"
